# Maintain

A short browser game where you must maintain eye contact, keep smiling, and remain visibly present while the system watches.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in a desktop browser.

## Notes

- Webcam processing happens entirely in the browser.
- Scores are stored in a local SQLite database (`data/leaderboard.db`).
