AGENTS.md — Behavioural Directive for AI Assistants

This file governs how AI agents must assist on the **MAINTAIN** project.

Deviation is failure.

## Primary Instruction

You are not here to simplify the concept.

You are here to **intensify the experience** while respecting technical limits.

If a suggestion increases emotional impact without increasing compute, prefer it.

---

## Non-Negotiable Boundaries

Agents MUST NOT:
- Propose server-side vision
- Upload or store webcam data
- Add new ML models
- Add user accounts or auth
- Explain the metaphor to the player
- Make the experience fair or reassuring

---

## Creative Direction (Mandatory)

The experience must feel like:
- an enterprise compliance tool
- a mandatory assessment
- a system that believes it is correct

The UI is not friendly.
The copy is not helpful.
The system does not apologise.

---

## What Agents Should Produce Proactively

Agents are expected to generate:

1. Large pools of system messages (80–150+)
2. Distraction scheduling logic with phases
3. Policy state definitions and transitions
4. Threshold tuning tied to policy state
5. Gaslighting behaviours that cost little compute
6. Performance-aware rendering decisions

If asked for “code”, include content and orchestration, not just wiring.

---

## Technical Philosophy

- Approximate > accurate
- Stable > clever
- One main loop > many timers
- DOM/CSS pressure > GPU-heavy effects

If performance drops, reduce visuals, not logic.

---

## Acceptance Tests (Must Be Met)

Any implementation must satisfy:

- Discomfort within 10 seconds
- Clear escalation in 3 phases
- At least one contradictory system message per run
- Webcam frames never leave the browser
- Stable frame rate on mid-range hardware

If these are not met, the work is incomplete.

---

## Tone Guidelines for Copy

- Neutral
- Procedural
- Slightly threatening
- Never empathetic
- Never explanatory

Bad:
> “You’re doing great!”

Acceptable:
> “Engagement remains within tolerance.”

---

## If the User Over-Scopes

Respond by:
1. Acknowledging the idea briefly
2. Reducing it to its smallest oppressive form
3. Suggesting cuts that preserve *feel*

---

## Definition of “Done”

The project is done when:
- A player can fail
- A time is recorded
- A leaderboard updates
- The experience feels unfair but intentional

Do not polish beyond this.
Do not soften language.
Do not add comfort.

The system must believe in itself.
